# Ben Schaefer Indie Project

This repository will hold my individual project for the semester.

### Problem Statement

I'm trying to solve the issues my friends are having with planning events by combining all of our schedules
into one big calender / list for all of us to edit and view. Might include event list and planner

///

I'm trying to create a program that will track the speed of a run through "Path of Exile" to optimize initial
play through of the main game. This will include a timer, stats, and tasks to complete.
